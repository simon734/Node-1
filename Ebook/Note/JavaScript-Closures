- Closures have access to the outer function’s variable even after the outer function returns
function celebrityName (firstName) {
    var nameIntro = "This celebrity is ";
    function lastName (theLastName) {
        return nameIntro + firstName + " " + theLastName;
    }
    return lastName;
}
​
​var mjName = celebrityName ("Michael"); // At this juncture, the celebrityName outer function has returned.​
​
mjName ("Jackson"); // This celebrity is Michael Jackson
